# Roadmap

Goal: complete self learning platform to attain ~B2 level Irish speaker of Mayo dialect.

## Q1

- Diarization api integration
- UI modification to accomodate above
- foiteadail api integration (if it works and they allow it)
- UI improvements based on above

## Reverted features

All of the following were implemented in the past but poorly so I reverted. There's no reason why they can't be revisited and improved to the point where they are useful.

- AI tutor Q and A (RAG + LLM + chat interface) e.g. grammar, pronunciation, 'how do you say this in Irish?'
- rangs (human tutor) user scoped with word lists and recordings
- lists / collections / tags / situational lexicons, ai generated e.g. "what do you say when discussing the weather?"
- speech practice integrated caotharnach (chat practice with AI mayo dialect)
- spaced repetition quizes for vocabulary and listening comprehension
- progress tracking based on the above (e.g. how much time until B2 level?)
