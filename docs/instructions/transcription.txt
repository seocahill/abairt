I want to create a new transcribe api that will be used to transcribe audio files.

The user will recive a dictionary entry to transcribe.

They will have the option to listen to the whole voice recording to get context.

They can skip to another one if they want.

Only untranscribed dictionary entries will be shown.

A user will recieve an email prompting them to transcribe the next entry.

In order to be mobile friendly the user can record a voice audio "transcription instructions" to be used as a prompt for an llm to write the transcription in english and irish.

The user can then review the transcriptions and confirm they are correct.

There is also the option to write the transcriptions in english and irish.

The user can then submit the dictionary_entry.
