I need you to integrate an api that will automatically segement and diarize uploade voice_recordings.

Upon successful upload a job will be spawned to send the following request (this is a python example lifted from api docs, you get the idea). The ruby api interfaceadapter should be in a service that will be called by the job.

```
import requests

url = "https://api.pyannote.ai/v1/diarize"
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
file_url = 'https://example.com/sample.mp3'
webhook_url = 'https://example.com/your-webhook-url'
headers = {
   "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
}
data = {
    'webhook': webhook_url,
    'url': file_url
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

print(response.status_code)
# 200

print(response.json())
# {
#  "jobId": "bd7e97c9-0742-4a19-bd5a-9df519ce8c74",
#  "message": "Job added to queue",
#  "status": "pending"
# }
```

The results are sent to the webhook_url in the response. So we need to create a webhook endpoint that will receive the results and save them to the database.

```
# payload example
{
    "jobId": "bd7e97c9-0742-4a19-bd5a-9df519ce8c74",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "output": {
        "diarization": [
            {
                "start": 1.2,
                "end": 3.4,
                "speaker": "SPEAKER_01"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

This payload should be saved to the database using a jsonb column on voice_recordings.

Afterwards another job will be spawned to create the dictionary_entries for the voice_recordings using the diarization data.

Temporary users will be created for each speaker and the dictionary_entries will be created for each speaker.

The UI will expose a form to replace or edit the temporary users and the dictionary_entries on the voice_recordings show page.

You should add some tests for the diarization service. You can mock the api call and test the response.
