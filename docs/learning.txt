I'd like to add two new interfaces to the app:

1. A quiz/exercise interface
2. A chat interface

The quiz interface will used spaced repetition to help the user learn.

The chat interface is the class chatgpt style ui.

Both interfaces are scoped to the logged in current user.

Can you build out the initial UI for these features?  The more complex business logic can be added later.
