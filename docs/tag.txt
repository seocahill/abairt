If missing a tag allow a user to add it and run a job on the good or better entries to see if the tag is appropriate.

A tag can be a single word or a description of a scenario.

E.g. "seaweed" (this would tag anything to do with seaweed, fishing etc)

We can use ai to decide if the tag is appropriate or not.

Would vector search be a better way to do this?

E.g. "seaweed" (this would tag anything to do with seaweed, fishing etc)

We can use ai to decide if the tag is appropriate or not.
